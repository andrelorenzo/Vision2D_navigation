# Navigation control and object avoidance for small and low-cost UAVs (Windows)

> [!NOTE]
> This work is part of the Master's Thesis at the Masterâ€™s Degree in Robotics and Automation at University Carlos III, Madrid

> [!WARNING]
> This branch has the Windows support code for the project, intalling cuda, cudnn and compiling OpenCV with cuda support is on you (good luck! :/), nevertheless in the "Codigos_PC" README.md is a somehow helpfull tutorial to make it work but it is definitely not guaranted!!   

This repo is divided into 3 separete folders:

* Codigos_PC: Codes and algorithm for the inference and OpenCV operation with MiDaS, yolo v11 for the obstacle avoidance. [Windows tutorial](/home/andrelorent/Programming/Vision2D_navigation/Codigos_PC/README.md)
* Codigos_ESPNOW: Codes for the ESP32 modules that serve either as master and camera.
* Memoria: Documentation of the project.
* Videos: Video demostrations, examples and different test of the project.

TODO:
* Add README.md for Codigos_ESPNOW
